## Research questions
---
In this project, our goal is to analyze the causality of emotion in user reviews. We will use methods for emotional sentiment analysis of text to extract the emotional value of a review (e.g. using [Evaluative Lexicon](http://www.lexicalsuite.com) or [Hedometer's](https://hedonometer.org/words/labMT-en-v1) happiness score table). These methods will not cluster review as positive or negative. Instead, they will quantify it with a number that describes emotional intensity (e.g., on a scale from 1-10).
<!-- <br><br>
Moreover, we are trying to answer the following hypotheses:
- Is the higher ABV (percentage of alcohol in beer) causing people to write more emotional reviews?
- Do users write more emotional reviews during weekend as they are able to relax more than during the week?
- Is there a seasonal trend of emotions during the year as it is the case with rating scores?
- Can we relate emotion with higher review score?
- Are users becoming less emotional with time?
- How do different metrics for a review's emotion impact the conclusions?
- Can we relate the obtained results to prior scientific findings?  -->

Moreover, we are trying to test the following hypotheses:
- The higher ABV (percentage of alcohol in beer) causes people to write more emotional reviews.
- Users write more emotional reviews during the weekend as they can relax more than during the week.
- There is a seasonal trend of emotions during the year. For example, we expect more emotions during holidays.
- Strong feelings are correlated with higher review scores.
- Users become less emotional over time (e.g., as they give more reviews)

Additionally:
- How do different metrics for a review's emotion impact the conclusions?
- Can we relate the obtained results to prior scientific findings?

<!-- <br><br><br><br>
- how is emotion of review related to ABV of beers
- which reviews are the most emotional (who wrote them, what do they describe)
- emotional trends during the week or months (e.g. peaks when one gets salary)
- relation between emotion and ratings (overall, taste, etc)
- emotion over time (fix a user, test is he more emotional during weekend) -->
