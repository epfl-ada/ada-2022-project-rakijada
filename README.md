## Abstract
---
REMINDER: ABSTRACT UP TO 150 WORDS

We could say that nearly everyone agrees that if we drink alcohol we feel better. However, we have to keep in mind that it can be hard to scientifically confirm such expectations, as we can see in [REF TO 1]. 

Our idea is to introduce emotional context into beer reviews. We will use emotional sentiment analysis of users' reviews. We will not cluster the reviews as positive or negative. Instead, we will quantify them with a number that describes emotional intensity (e.g, on a scale from 1-10). This will provide us with a new feature that we will focus on.

Interesting hypothesis we will investigate is if the higher ABV causes people to write more emotional reviews. According to our initial analysis this seems quite likable, since higher ABV is related to higher ratings.

## Research questions
---
In this project, our goal is to analyze the causality of emotion in user reviews. We will use methods for emotional sentiment analysis of text to extract the emotional value of a review (e.g. using [Evaluative Lexicon](http://www.lexicalsuite.com) or [Hedometer's](https://hedonometer.org/words/labMT-en-v1) happiness score table). These methods will not cluster review as positive or negative. Instead, they will quantify it with a number that describes emotional intensity (e.g., on a scale from 1-10).
<!-- <br><br>
Moreover, we are trying to answer the following hypotheses:
- Is the higher ABV (percentage of alcohol in beer) causing people to write more emotional reviews?
- Do users write more emotional reviews during weekend as they are able to relax more than during the week?
- Is there a seasonal trend of emotions during the year as it is the case with rating scores?
- Can we relate emotion with higher review score?
- Are users becoming less emotional with time?
- How do different metrics for a review's emotion impact the conclusions?
- Can we relate the obtained results to prior scientific findings?  -->

Moreover, we are trying to test the following hypotheses:
- The higher ABV (percentage of alcohol in beer) causes people to write more emotional reviews.
- Users write more emotional reviews during the weekend as they can relax more than during the week.
- There is a seasonal trend of emotions during the year. For example, we expect more emotions during holidays.
- Strong feelings are correlated with higher review scores.
- Users become less emotional over time (e.g., as they give more reviews)

Additionally:
- How do different metrics for a review's emotion impact the conclusions?
- Can we relate the obtained results to prior scientific findings?

<!-- <br><br><br><br>
- how is emotion of review related to ABV of beers
- which reviews are the most emotional (who wrote them, what do they describe)
- emotional trends during the week or months (e.g. peaks when one gets salary)
- relation between emotion and ratings (overall, taste, etc)
- emotion over time (fix a user, test is he more emotional during weekend) -->
